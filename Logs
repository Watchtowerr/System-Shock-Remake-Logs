Destroying the Laser
Althea, I have a plan; the only way to stop the mining laser is to fire it
into the station's own shields! I barely made it to my office, so you'll
need to get up to the Research level, get Isotope X-22 for the shięlds,
and get the Safety Override code for the laser in the Research Library.
Head down to Reactor and use X22 to power the shields. The laser
can be fired from the Research central control afker you enter the
safety override code number-(Gunshot) Ah!

SHODAN has locked down the elevators. Mira says if we can lower the

 SHODAN's been stretched too thin. With SHODAN controlling or 
 monitoring every system on the station, it isn't surprising to see her 
 built-in security subroutine showing its flaws. As of now, it is randomly 
 sealing storage lockers and storing the code to access them in 
 cybercores that are only accessible via cyberspace. Throwing this 
 useless information into the same cores as sensitive station 
 information will create an exploit. I'll have SHODAN generate defensi

Citadel Station should be remembered for how it contributed to 
 humanity's ongoing exploration of the cosmos. This is why I suggest 
 that we utilize this moment to study the two major impacts on the 
 human psyche during space travel: Anxiety and stress. To accomplish 
 this, the design of each level of the station should be made in such a 
 way that it induces these emotions. Having the staff of the station 
 working and living in these spaces for months or years at a time can 
 tell us so much more than any computer model ever could. The 
 importance of this data set in designing ships cannot be understated.

 Hacker, we've got a new situation here. A few seconds ago, we 
 caught a surge of activity on the station. Our best guess is that 
 SHODAN is preparing to download itself to Earth's CommNet. This 
 cannot happen. We need to take out the four Antennae Relays on the 
 Engineering level. To do this, there should be some plastique 
 explosive in the Storage level that can get the job done. Maybe one

 Destroying Citadel Station 
 Well... TriOp has made the decision to destroy the station. You'll need 
 to carry it out. To activate the self-destruct you'll need to get the 
 System Authorization code. According to our database, Willard Richie 
 is our best shot at figuring out that unique code. He was stationed 
 on Engineering... see if he's still alive. Once you have the code, head 
 to the Reactor Core. Get some advanced radiation protection, or at 
 the least, a hell of a lot of Detox. Enter the code inside the Reactor 
 core, throw the switch, and the destruct signal from Earth will start the countdown. Get to the Flight Deck, and use the code 001 to open the lifepods in one of the Flight Bays. I'll see you Earthside in a few months.
